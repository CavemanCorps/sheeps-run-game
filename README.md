# sheeps-run-game
lil comedy endless runner game I made for fun

TODO:
Everything is good for the most part. However, a few tweaks would be nice:
* a warning letting player know of incoming crazy spasm blocks
* one of the word blocks is not properly tuned
* streamlined level music changer function
* stop small cross forgrounds from overlapping the big ones
* pressure-sensitive jump button, like from Google's dinosuar game
* add more cool animation easter eggs

TODO: out of nowhere, a line shows up in the background. Fix asap and reupload on Newgrounds.
