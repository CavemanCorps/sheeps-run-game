# sheeps-run-game
lil comedy/horror runner game I made for fun

TODO:
Everything is good for the most part. However, a few tweaks would be nice:
* a warning letting player know of incoming crazy spasm blocks
* one of the word blocks is not properly tuned

TODO: out of nowhere, a line shows up in the background. Fix asap and reupload on Newgrounds.
